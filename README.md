A guide to the Braille alphabet and numbers, for GDP's birthday. 
Sharing in case anyone else has the kinds of hobbies and has been wanting to learn Braille.

*Sample:*

## Is this all of Braille?

No, you'd still need to learn punctuation and contractions to really read Braille. Also, feeling the dots is very different from reading them, and I don't have good advice about how to do that.

## Rationale

Doing this was also a way to test out some of my language learning ideas, even though this was just teaching a writing system:

* Make learning about *discovery* rather than using explicit instruction
* Frequent repetition in a variety of contexts, rather than using static flashcards that get stale fast
* Encourage discovery of meta-patterns and extrapolation to unseen items
