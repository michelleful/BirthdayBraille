# Birthday Braille

A guide to the Braille alphabet and numbers, for GDP's birthday. 
Sharing in case anyone else has the same hobby and has been wanting to learn.

*Sample:*

1) Clinton's VP was ​⠁⠇​ Gore. 
 
2) Her head is in the clouds; she's in ⠇⠁­-⠇⠁-­⠇⠁nd.

## Rationale

Doing this was also a way to test out some of my language learning ideas, even though this was just teaching a writing system:

* Make learning about *discovery* rather than using explicit instruction
* Frequent repetition in different contexts to minimise boredom, rather than using static flashcards that get boring after a while
* Encourage discovery of meta-patterns and extrapolation to unseen items

## Feedback

Open a Github issue or contact me on Twitter with comments, corrections, questions. @michelleful in both places.
